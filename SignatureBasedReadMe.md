# Links Required for Signature Based Detection

The following link is where the saved model (as a .h5 file) is stored in Google Drive. It can be obtained by downloading it from the link.

The next link is where the zipped data set is stored in Google Drive. It can also be obtained by downloading it from the link.

The next link is the Google Colab notebook (titled CS_6301_Project_Final_Notebook) used to create the model

The next link is a notebook used to test the ability to predict the classifcation by converting files to byte plot representations. It is largely the same as "predict_files.py", but is there for reference.

## Generating A Model

In order to generate the model, import the notebook CS 6301 Project Final Notebook in Google Colab. The zipped data set needs to be downloaded, unzipped, and then uploaded to Google Colab, after which all the cells need to be run to generate the model file. It should be noted that Google Colab premium was used to run the noteboook using a TPU environment within an hour, and it may take a lot longer on a normal environment. 

After that, a ".h5" file should be generated (the model file), which can be saved to local storage. 

## Using the model to create malware predictions on the simulated environment

For running the predictions on the simulated environment, python3 needs to be installed, and the following libraries need to be downloaded via "pip install [library-name]":

tensorflow, keras, numpy, pillow, matplotlib

The model should be imported into the simulated environment. For ease of use, one can simply download the saved model file from the Google Drive link above (though one can also use the model file generated on their own via the previous steps). 

Once in the simulated environment, create a directory and place both the model file and the "predict_files.py" file along with whatever files you would like to test in that directory. In order to get predictions on those files, simply run "python predict_files.py", and it will print to the console whether or not the model thinks it is malware. It will also save the created byteplot images to the directory for viewing.
