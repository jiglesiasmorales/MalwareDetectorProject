## Generating Model

## Using the model to create malware predictions on the simulated environment

For running the predictions on the simulated environment, python3 needs to be installed, and the following libraries need to be downloaded via "pip install [library-name]":

tensorflow, keras, ...

Once in the simulated environment, create a directory and place the "predict_files.py" file along with whatever files you would like to test. In order to get predictions on those files, simply run "python predict_files.py", and it will print to the console whether or not the model thinks it is malware. It will also save the created byteplot images to the directory for viewing.
