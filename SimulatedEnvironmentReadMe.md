# Setting up the Simulated Linux Environment

This readme will discuss how to setup the simulated environment for the project.

## Context

A simulated environment is required to ensure that the malware detection tactics
can be easily and safely tested. This document contains the steps required to set
up the simulated environment to ensure everyone who works on this project is working
within the same environment.

In cloud environments, most applications run on a VM which is why the simulated
environment chosen for this project is a Linux Ubuntu Virtual Machine.

## Requirements

* At least 8GB of system RAM available in your PC
    *   4GB will be allocated to the environment and the remaining system RAM
        will be used to run the actual hypervisor.
* At least 8 virtual cores
    * 8 virtual/logical cores will be allocated to the VM.
* At least 12GB of hard drive space available
    * 12GB will be allocated to the VM
* An ISO of [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/).
* A hypervisor/VM software
    * Hyper-V (included in Windows machines)
    * VMWare (Available for Windows & Mac. Free for personal use)

## Setup

Once the requirements have been fetched. The following steps should be followed
1. Launch preferred Hypervisor VM software
2. Create new VM
3. Select Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as the OS (select the ISO downloaded earlier)
4. Configure the RAM settings to be 4GB (4096 MB)
5. Configure the CPU settings to use 8 virtual cores.
6. Configure the VM storage to be 12GB
7. Allow access to the web through your ethernet/wifi connection.


Once the above steps have been followed, then you should be able to boot into the Ubuntu
OS. You will be asked for a pin, please ensure you do not forget this pin.

After setting up Ubuntu, it should restart and you should be able to use it normally.

NOTE: If you are using Hyper-V, you may get an unexpected blue login page. If so, then click on
view and UNCHECK the Enhanced view option. This should fix it and you should see the ubuntu
desktop.

If you have a higher resolution display (1440p+), then I highly recommend changing
the display resolution 1080p or higher.

You will likely be asked to update software at this point, install the updates and restart the
VM.

It is recommended to install support software in the Ubuntu instance to assist in development.
I would recommend installing atleast the following:
1. VS Code
2. Git
